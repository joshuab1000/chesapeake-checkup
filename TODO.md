# Chesapeake Checkup

### Todo

- Allow user to enter text in location select combobox. Suggest autofill options for it, and return to the deafult value if they delete their entry.
- Create a logo and set it as the icon.
- Create classes for each window.
- Add graph on stats window.
- Add descriptions of each parameter as popups.
- Prevent a new window from opening if the last window that was opened has the same location name.
- Add a way for the user to toggle the upload dates on and off for a substance (these aren't always the same for a location)
- Add a way for the user to choose how far back they want the data to go (more time = more delay when making calls)
    - Create an error message to tell users that "this location has no data in the selected timeframe"

### In Progress ···
- Fix the sizing of the page
